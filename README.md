# GM
 This is my configuration. Use it or don't I don't mind.

## Risks
- **Game Crashes:** You may not be able to start Garry's Mod or it may crash suddenly after starting if the configuration in `autoexec.cfg` or another file is not supported by any updates or modifications to Garry's Mod, or if you're playing an older version.
- **Hardware Issues:** You agree to the risks that your computer or any other device running Garry's Mod can crash and lose data if using `hq.cfg` and `lq.cfg` due to hardware not being well-equipped to handle the graphics or immediate changes. This is unlikely but can occur with older hardware such as 32-bit processors or 32-bit program binaries in Garry's Mod, so make sure to remove `-nochromium` from Launch Options and select Chromium Beta in Beta Branches.
- **Loss of Binds:** You also agree to the potential of losing binds by using `binds.cfg` due to the removal of the commented out "unbindall" console command. If you are working with the config, I highly recommend removing it completely, even if it is commented out, for your own sanity.
